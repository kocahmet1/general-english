║   Words that NATURALLY go together in English                               ║
║                                                                              ║

║   Why do we say "make a decision" and not "do a decision"?                  ║
║   → There's NO logical reason! Native speakers just say it that way.        ║
║   → You must LEARN and MEMORIZE collocations.                               ║
║                                                                              ║
║   Why are collocations important?                                           ║
║   ✓ They make your English sound NATURAL                                    ║
║   ✓ Native speakers use them constantly                                     ║
║   ✓ Using wrong collocations sounds awkward                                 ║
║                                                                              ║
